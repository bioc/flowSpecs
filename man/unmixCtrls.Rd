\description{
This is a flowSet with 14 spectral unmixing controls:
11 single-stained bead populations, 1 unstained bead, one dead-cell-marker-
stained PBMC sample, one unstained PBMC sample, working as a control for the
dead cell marker, and one autofluorescence control, which is also unstained
PBMC (in fact the same sample as the negative control for the dead cell
marker). Data acquired on a 44 detector, 3 laser Cytek AuroraÂ® instrument by
J Theorell.
