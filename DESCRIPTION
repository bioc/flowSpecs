Description: This package is intended to fill the role of conventional cytometry
        pre-processing software, for spectral decomposition, transformation, 
        visualization and cleanup, and to aid further downstream analyses, such
        as with DepecheR, by enabling transformation of flowFrames and flowSets
        to dataframes. Functions for flowCore-compliant automatic 
        1D-gating/filtering are in the pipe line. 
        The package name has been chosen both as it will deal with spectral
        cytometry and as it will hopefully give the user a nice pair of
        spectacles through which to view their data.
