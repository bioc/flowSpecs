+ Submitted to BioConductor
flowSpecs v0.99.1 (Release date: 2019-09-18)
==============

Changes:

+ Version change, to suit BioConductor.
==============

Changes:

+ Formal tests included for all user functions.
+ It is no longer allowed to run the specMatCalc function with only one color
+ as this leads to internal computational problems and is anyway meaningless.

flowSpecs v0.9.1 (Release date: 2019-09-16)
==============

Changes:

+ This is the first more proper package function, and the first time it has the
+ name "flowSpecs" (both as it will deal with spectral cytometry and as it will
+ hopefully give the user a nice pair of spectacles through which to view their
+ data). This means that the previous "theFlowSpec" package is from now on
+ deprecated.
