flowSpecs v0.9.1 (Release date: 2019-09-16)
==============

Changes:

* This is the first more proper package function, and the first time it has the
* name "flowSpecs" (both as it will deal with spectral cytometry and as it will
* hopefully give the user a nice pair of spectacles through which to view their
* data). This means that the previous "theFlowSpec" package is from now on
* deprecated.
